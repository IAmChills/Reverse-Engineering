# Reverse Engineering

This World of Warcraft addon calculates and displays the raw materials required to craft profession items, factoring in both the parent items and their sub-items. It provides a detailed breakdown of the materials needed, highlighting quantities already owned and indicating progress toward crafting goals. The addon dynamically adjusts for materials fulfilled indirectly through parent items, ensuring an accurate and user-friendly display.
